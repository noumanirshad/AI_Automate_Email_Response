# AI_Automate_Email_Response
This project aims to automate repetitive email inquiries using AI. It leverages IMAP, analyzes email content, suggests responses, and learns from user feedback. This improves efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

This source code for a web-based software solution designed to streamline and automate the process of handling repetitive email inquiries received at a company's info@ email address. Leveraging IMAP functionality and artificial intelligence (AI), the system extracts incoming emails, analyzes them, and provides suggested responses. Over time, through user feedback and interaction, the AI continuously learns and improves its accuracy, ultimately enabling the automation of responses to certain inquiries.
